# Input parameters are used when constructing a child component in order to give this child component its data.

# Output is quite often used in response to some event within a child component so that the parent can receive
some information when some event like a click occurs within a child.

# You can only pass along a single value with a event emitter so if you need to send multiple values you can just
wrap them in an object first.
