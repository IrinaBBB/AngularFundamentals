# Input parameters are used when constructing a child component in order to give this child component its data.

# Output is quite often used in response to some event within a child component so that the parent can receive
some information when some event like a click occurs within a child.

# You can only pass along a single value with a event emitter so if you need to send multiple values you can just
wrap them in an object first.

# reference variable is a way that we can use to access public method and properties of a child component.
Template reference variables are used for this.

# interpolation {{ user.name }} -> putting expression in curly braces
# property binding [src]="user.imageUrl" -> putting expression in quotes
# event binding (click)="doSomething()" -> putting statement in quotes
